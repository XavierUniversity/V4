To initialize locally, you will need to run the following commands.

`cd` to the repository directory and run the following commands:

- `npm install` - Installs Grunt dependencies defined in package.json
- `bower install` - Installs Bower dependencies defined in bower.json
- `npm update` and `bower update` can be used to update any dependencies that may have changed versions since install or the last update. If updates are desired, package.json and bower.json will have to be coded properly.

After running these, simply run `grunt prod` to run production quality tasks.
