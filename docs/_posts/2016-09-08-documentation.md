Documentation will be managed using the `/docs` folder within the master repository and will be available through GitHub Pages.

Anyone with write access to the master branch can and should update the documentation, as appropriate.

To render the site locally through Jekyll, follow [these steps](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) outlined by GitHub. Otherwise follow the patterns in the `_posts` folder.
